# MNIST-Algorithm
<h1> Description </h1>
The Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Barcode, is a structure that handles an image from a given database and searches for the closest image.  Briefly, within this paper it is demonstrated by using a image database (MNIST) holding 10 images of each digit from 0 through 9, and later finding the binarization of the images through the use of projections, and is compared to other images using their binary and comparing the two using their hamming distance(s). <br /> <br /> <b>(Main Algorithm is run on Image.py) </b>
